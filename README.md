## Project Summary

>This project will prompt the user to create a username in order to play our "Slot Machine" game. The slot machine will generate random images using the GIF API that will each have different values, and depending on the particular values or 
the combination of values given, the machine will generate a score. The user will have 5 lever pulls in order to generate the highest score possible. Once the users turn is over, the score is shown and transferred to a list showing the highsest scores achieved playing this game. Background music will play using a Sound API not chosen yet, and data will be stored using firebase database.
